## Roll of the Dice

```{r}
trials <- do(1000)*length(unique(sample(1:6, replace=TRUE)))
```


## A more realistic die?

A the outcomes from a physical die does not necessarily have the equal probabilities associated with textbook dice.  How big a discrepancy is needed to make an observable difference in the probabilities of 3s and 5s?

For example, suppose one face was twice as likely as any other given face to come up.

```{r}
t_2 <- do(1000)*length(unique(sample(1:6,prob=c(1,1,2,1,1,1), 6,replace=TRUE)))
tally(t_2)
```

The standard error is approximately $1000 \sqrt(.27*(1-.27)/1000) = ```r 1000*sqrt(.27*(1-.27)/1000)``` , or
