<h1>Reflection on “Sleepless Nights” by Patti Neighmond</h1>

<p>Thinking about the sample-pool, the study in the article did a decent job of having a large enough pool – <strong>1300 people</strong> – in order to get results that are reflective of the actual population.   However, the article did not confirm that the 1300 people came from <strong>different backgrounds and lifestyles</strong>.  Due to the lack of specification, I cannot read this report through an academic lens and assume that their pool was accurately <strong>representative of the population</strong>.  <strong>What if most of the pool came from coastal areas, and humidity has a large affect on dementia?</strong>  What if 1200 of the 1300 people were actually over 90 years old?  These questions that linger post-reading make me want a more-detailed account of this study.  </p>

<p>All skepticism aside, I was astounded by the claim that adults with sleeping problems were <strong>twice as likely</strong> to develop dementia.  It’s quite difficult to argue with this statistic.  Due to my lack of statistics-education, though, I am unsure as to how sure they can be about that assumption when applying it to the population as a whole.  </p>
