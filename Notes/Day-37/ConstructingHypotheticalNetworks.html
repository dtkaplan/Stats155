<h1>Constructing Hypothetical Causal Networks</h1>

<h3>Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach</h3>

<p>Each of the following settings consists of a relationship of interest to you, the modeler, as well as several other factors that might play a role.</p>

<p>Draw a hypothetical causal network that reflects your (common sense) understanding of the relationships among the factors.  Make sure that you have the causal direction indicated according to your beliefs.  (Don&#39;t include very weak connections; just ones that you think might be pretty strong.) You can use the words <strong>in bold</strong> as the names of your network nodes.</p>

<p>Be prepared to give a justification for each arrow you draw, or for each potential arrow that you don&#39;t include in your network.</p>

<p>Later, we&#39;ll analyze the networks to decide what factors ought to be included as covariates.</p>

<h2>The New Puppy</h2>

<p>You want to see whether people are happier after they get a puppy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they have a new <strong>puppy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Happiness</strong></li>
<li>Amount of <strong>sleep</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Gift Giving</h2>

<p>A researcher wants to understand the relationship between two siblings &mdash; say, an older sister and a younger one &mdash; by measuring the older sister&#39;s change in happiness and the younger sister&#39;s change in happiness when the older gives a gift to her younger sister.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Older</strong> sister&#39;s change of happiness &mdash; response</li>
<li><strong>Younger</strong> sister&#39;s change of happiness &mdash; explanatory</li>
<li>The <strong>quality</strong> of the gift</li>
<li>The <strong>cost</strong> to the older sister of the gift</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Income and SAT Score</h2>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/sat-scores-and-family-income/">some evidence</a> that students from higher-income families tend to have higher SAT scores.  Suppose you undertake to study the relationship between income and SAT by analyzing data on individual students.</p>

<ul>
<li>Family <strong>income</strong></li>
<li><strong>SAT</strong> score</li>
<li><strong>IQ</strong></li>
<li>Quality of <strong>high-school</strong> education</li>
<li>Amount of <strong>tutoring</strong> for the SAT</li>
<li>Knowing how the <strong>system</strong> works overall (e.g. how to apply to college)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spending and Debt</h2>

<p>It&#39;s observed that people with higher debt tend to spend more.  You want to test the possibility that higher levels of debt tend to increase spending.</p>

<ul>
<li>Level of <strong>debt</strong></li>
<li>Amount of <strong>spending</strong></li>
<li>Yearly <strong>income</strong></li>
<li>Whether the person went to <strong>college</strong></li>
<li>The person&#39;s psychological <strong>prediliction</strong> to spend.</li>
<li>The person&#39;s life and work <strong>skills</strong>.</li>
</ul>
