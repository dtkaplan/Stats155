## Review: Traditional Tests

* p test
* t test
* one-way anova
* simple regression

These miss out on the ability to include covariates.  They do not give a measure of effect size.

One that we have not covered:

* $\chi^2$ (chi-squared) tests.




### Logistic Regression

When we do linear regression on a Zero/One variable, we are effectively modeling the probability.
* Easy to see if there is a single, categorical explanatory variable --- the model value is just the groupwise means in the different levels of the variable.
* A bit more subtle if the explanatory variable is quantitative.  Draw the picture with Zero/One response variable on the vertical axis and a quantitative variable on the horizontal axis.  Example: O-ring damage in the space shuttle.
```{r}
orings = fetchData("oring-damage.csv")
xyplot( damage ~ temp, data=orings,pch=20 )
```
Sketch in the best fitting line.  But a line is too "stiff" and needs eventually to escape 0-1.  

Remember that the idea of logistic regression is to fit a linear model to the "log odds", which is just the logarithm of $p/(1-p)$ --- a different format for the probability.  We haven't talked about **how** this is done.  That's more advanced.

### Odds and the Odds Ratio

Suppose we have some data on an illness and exposure to a potential toxin

            |Sick|Healthy
------------|---|---
Exposed     | A | B
Not Exposed | C | D

Among the exposed, the risk of being sick is $A/(A+B)$.

Among the unexposed, the risk of being sick is $C/(C+D)$.

The risk ratio is the ... ratio of the two risks!  It tells how much more likely you are to get the sickness if you are exposed.

Now suppose that the sickness is fairly rare, say roughly 1 in 1000.  It's a huge amount of work to measure the exposure on everybody.  Is it necessary, given that almost everybody is healthy.

To avoid this problem, it's common to do a **case/control** study, where we pick sick people from a clinic and a similar number of healthy controls.  (Call up the friends of the sick kids.  They will be similar in age, activities, etc.)

But now the ratio of A to B is wrong, it's roughly 1 to 1, whereas in the population it's roughly 1 to 1000

Instead, we calculate the odds and the odds ratio.  $\frac{A/C}{B/D}$  
Notice that if A is much less than B, and C is much less than D, the odds ratio is essentially the same as the risk ratio.


### The odds ratio in use

A study of bicycle helmet use and the influence of state law.

Demonstration of logistic regression and odds ratios.  "Effects of state helmet laws on bicycle helmet use by children and adolescents" [*Injury Prevention* **2002, 9**:42-46](http**://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/8/1/42.full.pdf)

The coefficients in logistic regression correspond to log-odds ratios.

When they say "adjusted Odds Ratio", they mean the odds ratio of one of the categorical variable levels relative to the reference level, with the other variables in the model as covariates.  Notice that they give a confidence interval on the odds ratio itself.  The calculation of this is straightforward given the standard error on the logistic regression coefficient.

Calculate the confidence interval on the odds ratio, e.g.
```{r}
exp( .7 + c(-1,1)*1.96*.294)
```

## Introduction to Causal Reasoning

One way to define a causal relationship between A and B is this: If you change A, then B will change.

The accepted method to establish a causal relationship is to do an experiment: Change A and observe whether B changes correspondingly.  The key word here is "change."  Simply observing that A varies and B varies with it does not establish causation; it might equally have been that B causes A or that A and B both have a common cause.  You need to impose the change directly on A.

But, what to do when you can't do an experiment.

Recidivism and Parole.

Public health issues: not every smoker gets lung cancer, not every person with lung cancer was a smoker.

### Austin Bradford Hill

A famous article, from 1965, about [causation in public health](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Epidemiology/Hill_1965.pdf).  It lays out 9 criteria to support a claim of a causal relationship, e.g. strength, consistency, temporality, specificity, plausibility, experiment.  

Hill, who followed Fisher as president of the Royal Statistical Society, dismisses *Tests of Significance*.

> No formal tests of significance can answer those questions [of causation].  Such tests can, and should, remind us of the effects that the play of chance can create, and they will instruct us in the likely magnitude of those effects.  Beyond that they contribute nothing to the 'proof' of our hypothesis.


#### Myopia

* [Myopia article from Nature](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/ISM/myopia.pdf).  Note the extensive scientific jargon and the dismissing of the lack of causal evidence: "Although it does not establish a causal link, the statistical strength of the association of night-time light exposure and child- hood myopia does suggest that the absence of a daily period of darkness during early childhood is a potential precipitating factor in the development of myopia."

It turns out that the parent's myopia is the disposing factor.  Shortsighted parents leave the lights on at night and their kids are shortsighted for genetic reasons.  <!-- A CNN news report is [here](http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9905/12/children.lights/index.htm). --> Here is a [rebuttal](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6774/full/404143a0.html).
