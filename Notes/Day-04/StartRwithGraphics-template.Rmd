# Making and Interpreting Statistical Graphics

## Your Name Goes Here!!!

```{r include=FALSE}
# You can ignore this chunk.  It does necessary
# stuff it set up the format.
library(mosaic)
opts_chunk$set(dev="svg",out.width="60%")
```

This is a template for the activity being introduced in class on *Starting R with Graphics*.  
* Your R code goes in the "chunks" offset by the 
<code>```{r}</code> fences.  
    So long as you follow the format in the examples, you'll be fine. (But you have to get the R statements right!)
* You can use the simple Markdown system to put in headings, bullet points, whatever.
* The R graphics will be included automatically.

You can even include photos or other non-R graphics to illuminate your report.  You don't really need them for this report, but just for fun ...

If you can't immediately figure out the above, don't spend even a second more trying.  It's just HTML.

## Loading in the Data

The `Births78` dataset is already included in the `mosaic` package, but more often we will be using data outside `mosaic`.  You will use a program called `fetchData()` to access data.  Here are some examples:
```{r}
births = fetchData("Births78")
grades = fetchData("grades.csv")
```

You're going to work with `births` in this report.

## Basic Modes of Graphics

We've discussed four basic modes of graphics:
* Scatterplot
* Histogram (which you've seen before)
* Density Plot (which we'll generally use instead of the histogram)
* Box-and-whisker plot

To get you started, here is a scatter plot such as we saw on the first day of class:
```{r}
xyplot( births~dayofyear, data=births )
```

Then you'll make a histogram, describe the pattern seen in it, and say how that pattern relates to the pattern in the scatter plot.

```{r}
histogram( ~ births, data=births )
```

## Constructing the Day of Week variable

You'll use the `transform()` function reasonably often, but you'll likely never use the "modular arithmetic" operator "%%".  In this case, we're just dividing the day of the year by 7, taking the remainder, which gives us a number 0 through 6 specifying the say of the week.

```{r}
births = transform( births, dayofweek=dayofyear%%7 )
```

## Using the day of the week variable

Make the various plots involving the `dayofweek` variable.

### How is it distributed?

### Using it as a `group=` argument to `xyplot()`.

### Using it as a `group=` argument to `densityplot()`
.

### Using it with the "Conditioned On" syntax

That is, your formulas might look like
```~ births | dayofweek```

You can copy over the following chunk template for each of your plots

```{r}
# Your commands go here
# Remember to include ```{r} before the chunk
# and ``` after it.
```

Good luck!
