## Review of Vocabulary

* Two hypotheses:
   * Null Hypothesis.  The star of the show.
        Some ways to think about it:
        * nothing is going on
        * coefficients are zero
        * vectors are random
        You either **reject** or **fail to reject** the Null.
    * The Alternative Hypothesis.  A supporting actor.
        * Your best guess of what's happening
        * The smallest interesting effect
        * The results of a preliminary study.
        You use this to design your study.  The Alternative needs to be very specific and drawn from expert knowledge.  There is a tradition in statistics education of referring to the alternative as an "anything but" kind of hypothesis.  This is a bad idea.
* Two kinds of error
    * Type I: Reject the Null even though the Null is right
    * Type II: Fail to reject the Null even though the Alternative is right.
* p-value: probability of the observed value or stronger under the Null
    * significance level --- the p-value is the "achieved significance level".  Comes from the idea of using confidence intervals to do a hypothesis test: related to the confidence level.
* power: probability of rejecting the Null under the Alternative Hypothesis.

## The Summary Report and the p-value

Show the t-statistic and the translation into a p-value.

Show the p-value reported on R^2.

Notice that the alternative plays no role whatsoever in the regression report.

## The Multi-World Metaphor for Statistical Inference 

Motto: *Always know what world you are thinking about.*

![Planet Earth](planet_earth.png)

We want to know which hypotheses are true on Earth and which are false.


The planets involved in statistical inference are:


Planet Sample | Planet Null | Planet Alt
--------------|-------------|--------
![Planet Sample](planet-sample.png) | ![Planet Null](venus.png) | ![Planet Alt](planet-alt.png) 


How to travel to the different worlds ...

* Planet Sample: resampling
* Planet Null: shuffling
* Planet Alt: You need to construct such a world (we'll pick this up today)

### App for playing with Significance and Power

```{r eval=FALSE}
fetchData("mHypTest.R")
mHypTest() # by default, a coefficient
```


### Stocks on Planet Null

```{r}
fetchData("getDJIAdata.R")
djia = getDJIAdata() # djia-2011.csv is the basic file
xyplot( Close ~ Date, data=djia)
```

Look at the day-to-day differences in log prices:
```{r}
dd = with( djia, diff( log(Close)))
mean(dd)
```

Subtract out the mean, shuffle, cumulative sum, and exponentiate to create a realization:
```{r}
ddnull = dd - mean(dd)
sim = exp(cumsum(shuffle(ddnull)))
xyplot(sim ~ Date, data=djia)
```


### Shuffling 

A proof for the existence of Extra-Sensory Perception!  If I can get you to focus on a number, I can predict, to some extent, your thought process.

Your birthday is a number that plays an important part in your thought process.  Generate a random number between 0 and your birday.

[Permutation test by hand](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/ISM/Activities/permutation-test.pdf)

Spreadsheet reading command:
```{r}
esp = fetchGoogle("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Am13enSalO74dE5iMjZrcGFjTUtJSjg0T05NLW84Mmc&single=true&gid=0&output=csv")
```

### Power

How did I know that I could reject the Null in the shuffling problem?  I did a little simulation.
```{r}
mysim <- function(n=15) {
   days = resample(1:31,size=n)
   nums = ceiling( runif(n,min=0,max=days))
   mod = lm(nums~days)
   list(r2=r.squared(mod), p=summary(mod)$coef[2,4])
}
s15 = do(1000)*mysim(24) # typical R^2 is about 0.4
mean(~r2, data=s15)
tally( ~ p<0.05, data=s15,format='proportion')
```

Do `mHypTest(TRUE)` setting the "effect size" to about 0.4
